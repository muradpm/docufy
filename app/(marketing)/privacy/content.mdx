We and others who use our Website or Services may collect the information you submit or make available through these interactive features. Any content you provide via the public sections of these features will be considered "public" and is not subject to the privacy protections referenced herein. By using these interactive features, you understand that the information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties for their own purposes.

### Information Collected Automatically

**Automatic Data Collection:** We keep track of certain information about you when you visit and interact with our Website or Services. This information may include your Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, MAC address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising and other unique identifiers, details about your browser, operating system or device, location information (including inferred general location based off of your IP address), Internet service provider, pages that you visit before, during and after using the Website or Services, information about the links you click, information about how you interact with the Website or Services, including the frequency and duration of your activities, and other information about how you use the Website or Services. Information we collect may be associated with accounts and other devices.

**Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, and Analytics Information:** We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies ("Technologies") to automatically collect information through the Website or Services. Technologies are essentially small data files placed on your devices that allow us and our partners to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Services.

**Analytics:** We may also use third-party service providers to collect and process analytics and other information on our Website or Services. These third-party service providers may use Technologies to collect and store analytics and other information. They have their own privacy policies addressing how they use the analytics and other information and we do not have access to, nor control over, third parties’ use of cookies or other tracking technologies.

**Advertising:** In using the Website or Services, we may allow select third party advertising technology partners to place Technologies on the browser of your device to collect information about you as discussed above. These third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers) may use this information to serve relevant content and advertising to you as you browse the Internet, and access their own Technologies on your browser to assist in this activity. If you are interested in more information about these online advertising activities, and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the [Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out link](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/), the [Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out link](http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/), or [Your Online Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. You can also opt out of certain online advertising activities by following the instructions in the "Your Choices" and "Your Privacy Rights" sections below. Please note that if you use these mechanisms, you may still see advertising on our Website or Services or across the Internet, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.

For example, if you access our Website or Services through a third-party application, such as a social networking site or a third-party login service, we may collect information about you from that third party that you have made available via your privacy settings.
