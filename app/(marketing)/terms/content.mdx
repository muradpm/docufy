## Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service are made available on a paid subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). Pricing and included features for the Subscriptions ("Subscription Plan(s)") are set forth here: [www.docufy.ai](https://docufy.ai/). "Subscription Fees" means all fees associated with your Subscription.

You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing Cycles are set on a monthly or yearly basis. Whether you are using monthly or yearly billing, your account may be charged on a monthly basis.

**Auto-Renewal**

You agree that at the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew and your payment method for such Subscription will automatically be charged at the start of each new Subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that Billing Cycle, under the same conditions as the prior Billing Cycle unless you cancel your Subscription prior to your renewal date.

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You must provide docufy with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Fragmanta to charge all Subscription Fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, docufy may attempt to charge the credit card on file one or more times. Should payment continue to fail, the Subscription will be, at docufy's sole discretion, canceled or downgraded and you may lose access to certain paid features and/or Fragmanta account.

You may cancel your Subscription either through your online account management page or by contacting us at [murad@docufy.ai](mailto:murad@docufy.ai) and indicating your intention to cancel your Subscription.

## Fees and Fee Changes

Fragmanta, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription Fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription Fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

docufy will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription Fees. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription Fees.

Subscription Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, "Taxes"). You will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your Subscription, except for those taxes based on our net income. Should any payment for the Service be subject to withholding tax by any government, you will reimburse us for such withholding tax.

## Free Trial

docufy may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial"). If you are on a Free Trial, you may cancel at any time until the last day of your Free Trial by following the cancellation procedures outlined in the Subscription section of these Terms. If you or docufy cancel your Free Trial, you acknowledge and agree that we may delete all of your User Content or data associated with the Workspace that was assigned to your Free Trial. If you do not cancel your Free Trial, then your Free Trial will be converted to a paid Subscription at the end of the trial period, and you hereby authorize us to charge your credit card or other payment method for continued use of the paid Service under such Subscription.

At any time and without notice, docufy reserves the right to (a) modify the terms and conditions of any Free Trial offer; (b) cancel any Free Trial offer; or (c) cancel any Free Trial Subscription at any time.

## Refunds

Payment obligations are non-cancelable, and fees paid are non-refundable and there are no credits for partially used Subscription periods.

## Exclusions

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages set forth in the "LIMITATION OF LIABILITY" and "DISCLAIMER" sections above, so the limitations above may not apply to you.

## Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Delaware, United States, excluding its conflicts of law rules.

## Dispute Resolution

If You have any dispute or concern about the Service, You agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us. The notice must be sent to docufy within thirty (30) days of your registering to use the Service or agreeing to these Terms, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with these Terms. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, docufy also will not be bound by them.

## Waiver

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.

## Entire Agreement

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and docufy regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.

## Survival

All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

## Changes to These Terms of Service

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms, including any Supplementary Terms, at any time. By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
